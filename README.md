## Credits
Based on Seth Coelen's [Skeleton-Sass](https://github.com/WhatsNewSaes/Skeleton-Sass), which usefully extends the famed [Skeleton Framework](http://getskeleton.com/) by David Gamache; additionally flavored using a few tricks from the [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate).
Using David Perry's [Cardo](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cardo) and Eduardo Tunni's [Pathway Gothic One](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Pathway+Gothic+One) font families. 
Inspired by Matt Modrowski's [Gulp Workflow](http://mattmodrowski.com/blog/using-gulp-in-your-web-design-workflow/) and the [common Sass file architecture](https://www.sitepoint.com/architecture-sass-project/).
